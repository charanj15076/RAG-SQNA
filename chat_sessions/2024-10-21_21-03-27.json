There are fourteen circles in the image, with the central one being larger and the others surrounding it. These circles seem to represent various components of the cart or perhaps a diagram of the cart's mechanism. The arrows are drawn to indicate how the circles are interconnected, forming a cohesive representation of the cart's structure. The white background allows the drawing and arrows to stand out, making the cart's components easier to understand and visualize.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "ai", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": [], "usage_metadata": null}]
